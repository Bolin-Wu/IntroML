Assignments
===========

Assignments will be continously updated during the course up until the week when the assignment is due.

Some exercises refer to additional files. These are located in the folder `additional_files`.

The Rtex files are TeX files that can be compiled with Knitr (in R-Studio). To change it back TeX, just remove the R chunks and and it should compile using ordinary TeX.

The makefile can be use to compile all files at once using:
```make pdf```.
